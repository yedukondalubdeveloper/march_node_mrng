[1] WHAT IS NODE JS IS ??
====================
        - JavaScript runtime build on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
        - JavaScript running on the server
        - Used to build powerful, fast & scalable web applications
        - Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
    NON-BLOCKING I/O
    ================
        - Works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
        - Supports tens of thousends concurrent connections
        - Optimizes throughput and scalability in web applications with many I/O operations
        - This makes Node.js apps extremely fast and efficient
    EVENT LOOP
    ==========
        - Single-threaded
        - Supports concurrency via events and calbacks
        - EventEmitter class is used to bind events and event listeners
    WHAT CAN WE BUILD WITH NODE.JS ?
    =================================
        - REST APIs & Backend Applications
        - Real-Time Services (Chat, Games, etc)
        - Blogs, CMS, Social Applications
        - Utilities & tools
        - Anything that is not CPU-intensive
    NPM
    ====
        - Node.js Package Manager
        - Used to install node programs/modules
        - Easy to specify and link dependencies
        - Modules get installed into the "node_modules" folder
        npm install express
        npm install-g express
    POPULAR MODULES
    ================
        - Express: Web development framework
        - Connect: Extensible HTTP server framework
        - Socket.io: Server side component for websockets
        - Pug/Jade: Template engine inspired by HAML
        - Mongo / Mongoose: Wrappers to interact with MongoDB
        - Coffee-Script: CoffeeScript compiler
        - Redis: Redis client library
    PACKAGE.JSON FILE
    =================
        - Goes in the root of your package/application
        - Tells npm how yur package is structured and what to do to install it
        npm init
